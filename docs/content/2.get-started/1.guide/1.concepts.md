## What is VueFinalModal?

`vue-final-modal` is a modal library built specifically for Vue.js and as such it makes some assumptions and enforces "best-practices" for your modals while being versatile and customizable.

`vue-final-modal` is a collection of [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html#what-is-a-composable) and Vue components, the main things that will be covered is how to use these components to build your own modal components and use them with [useModal()](/api/composables/use-modal) composable function.

### Built-in features

::list{type=success}
  - SSR (Nuxt 3) support. [Teleport](/api/components/vue-final-modal#teleportto) your modals to `'body'`{lang=ts} by default.
  - [`useModal()`{lang=ts}](/api/composables/use-modal) composable to manage your modal programmatically.
  - Trap keyboard focus within modal element (uses [focus-trap](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap) for best web accessibility).
  - Full control to the zIndex of the nested modals (see [zIndexFn prop](/api/components/vue-final-modal#zindexfn)).
  - Customizable `<Transition>` for the modal content and overlay.
  - Tiny footprint! Only 4.x kB! Vue Final Modal focuses on the core functionality of modals, leaves the complex CSS up to the developer.

### A Styleless component

[\<VueFinalModal>](/api/components/vue-final-modal) is a styleless component that provides the features that modal required as much as possible but leave the layout as a slot to developer.

So you have to define the modal style by yourself.
