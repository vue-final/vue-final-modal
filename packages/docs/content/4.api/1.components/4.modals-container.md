# `<ModalsContainer>`

A container for dynamic modals that created by `useModal()`.

`<ModalsContainer>`{lang=ts} is an [renderless component](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/) that is responsible for hosting the Vue instances of your dynamic modals. You don't need to do add anything else to the `<ModalsContainer>`{lang=ts}, as long as you include it in your Vue tree, you can use Dynamic modals.
